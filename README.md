# ECE5466: Project - ASL Interpreting Glove

**Team Members:**

* Kris Gurung
* Anirudhhan Raghuraman
* Madalyn Wiley

**Project Goals:**

* Design an American Sign Language (ASL)-interpreting glove that converts sign language to English and outputs the translation.
* Recognize and translate the entire ASL alphabet.
* Identify and process basic static signs.

**Future Goals:**

* Support for dynamic signs.
* Integration of two gloves for improved accuracy.
* PCB design for a sleeker and more compact build.

**Necessary Equipment and Sensors:**

* (2) ESP32 microcontrollers
* (15) Flex sensors
* (2) 8 Ohm speakers
* (2) MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensors
* (1) Pair of gloves

**Project Description:**

The ASL-interpreting glove will be designed to detect hand gestures and translate them into spoken words and a visual interface output. The system will consist of flex sensors to track finger movements, MPU6050 sensors for motion detection, and ESP32 microcontrollers to process and transmit data to an output system.

**Learning Goals:**

* Develop a database for storing and retrieving sensor values.
* Accurately measure sensor data using ESP32.
* Integrate ESP32 with an Android application.
* Combine multiple components into a fully functional product.

**Comparison to Existing Models:**

Two similar models exist:

* UCLAâ€™s Sign-to-Speech Translating Glove (details to be added)
